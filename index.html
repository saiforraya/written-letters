          <p>“I catch myself everyday thinking about you</p>
          <p>
            I don’t get why, it’s been months and I still think about you; I still check your
            accounts your TikTok reposts before you changed usernames or before you blocked me, I
            still care.
          </p>
          <p>Because what if</p>
          <p>
            I did things differently? I thought differently?<br />
            What if I tried harder?
          </p>
          <p>
            My life has been full of regrets, I think and think and think and I regret regret and
            regret lots, I let go of my regrets but the only regret I couldn’t let go of was when I
            ruined our relationship
          </p>
          <p>I only have myself to blame.</p>
          <p>You played a big role in my life</p>
          <p>
            And you affected me, not in a single bad way, all I have of you is good, all I remember
            is your smile, your laugh, the times you’d giggle, the times you’d watch while on call
            with me, the times I’d admire you doing your own thing while I’m there admiring you
          </p>
          <p>You came into my life for a reason</p>
          <p>What was the reason? I don’t know.<br />So why?”</p>

          <h2><span class="lead">birthday</span></h2>
          <p class="entry-date">February 5, 2026</p>
          <p>
            It was my birthday today, yet the only thing I could think about since the moment it
            turned 12, was you; I would be lying if I said I didn’t wait for a response, I want to
            hear back from you
          </p>
          <p>
            Every hour of the day I check sendthesong, instagram just incase it didn’t notify me of
            a message from you yet all I see is, “liked a message - 16hrs ago.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I saw a note in sendthesong, it had white Ferrari on it. I couldn’t help but wonder if
            it’s you, I don’t wanna reach out for the third time and ask in case it isn’t you
          </p>
          <p>
            And what if, you never wanted to hear from me again? What if the like reaction meant me
            to stop? Then that would seem I’d be pushing. I don’t want to push
          </p>
          <p>So here I am, writing hoping you’d come back and check</p>
          <p>
            Anyway, I had a great birthday it was simple but I was surrounded by my close family
            even when I requested that I didn’t want any celebration, mwuahaha the ice cream was
            yummy!
          </p>
          <p>
            Deep inside I wish I could’ve spent this birthday with you, and all my future ones.

          <p>hi rayaa, i don’t know why i’m writing this when i know it won’t reach you.</p>
          <p>
            maybe it’s the sound of the waves. being here feels nostalgic—back when i used to wish
            you were here with me so we could experience it together, take morning strolls here
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            i don’t know why you keep showing up in my mind in every place i used to go when we were
            still together. maybe it’s because i always wished you were there with me whenever i
            visited new places, whenever i saw something beautiful. i can’t help but imagine your
            smile seeing this view… and then i end up admiring you more than the view itself.

            the waves are pretty, aren’t they? even the whole ride on the way here, you were on my
            mind. i kept wishing i could’ve brought you with me.

            i miss you so much. but i know every time i came back, it hurt you—every time i returned,
            it took pieces of you.
          </p>
          <p>
            i don’t want to hurt you anymore. so i’ll carry this love quietly, and i’ll carry it with
            me. i love you, and i’m sorry if it’s one-sided now. i just wish i could find my way back
            to you without causing you pain.
          </p>
          <p>
            you’re still worth so much to me, raya. you matter a lot. and if this ever reaches you, i
            hope someday i can make up for my mistakes with you.

          <p>
            you were never just another person in my life. you were my first love—the first person
            i ever saw a future with, the first and only one i truly thought i could marry. you
            still matter to me more than you realize, even now.
          </p>
          <p>
            and i really hope you find a place where you feel like you belong, even if it isn’t
            with me.

          <h2><span class="lead">still yours</span></h2>
          <p>
            I saw a TikTok asking “what song do you refuse to play because of the memories?” and I
            immediately thought of Bad by w2e. It's all you, I've never dedicated another song to
            anybody but you. I'm happy that I still have something that connects me to you, but it
            also hurts having a connection to you without having you. Life feels ephemeral without
            you.

          <h2><span class="lead">Unconditional</span></h2>
          <p>
            you were, and still are, my image of unconditional love. the seven months we had weren’t
            perfect, but you stayed—loving me even when it was hard for you, even when i didn’t
            treat you the way you deserved, even when i was immature.
          </p>
          <p>
            it wasn’t the best for me either, but deep down i knew you were the embodiment of
            unconditional love. i hate that it took me so long to realize that. i hate that i took
            you for granted while you were there, loving me in every way you could.
          </p>
          <p>
            and now i want to reciprocate what you gave me. i’d do anything just to give back even a
            portion of the love you once gave me. i know the love i gave you back then might not
            have been the kind of love you imagined or needed, and i know i’m too late. i ruined the
            one chance you gave me to make it right, and it kills me.

          <h2><span class="lead">The Plumeria</span></h2>
          <p>
            I’m not sure if you remember, but do you remember when I took a picture of a plumeria
            flower? And I told you, “while the other flowers were starting to rot, you were there
            perfect as everrr hihihi.” Mwuahahaha.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still see you the same way. Like that flower—still perfect in my eyes. Maybe you see
            me as one of the plumerias that wilted, and maybe I did. But I want you to know I didn’t
            pick that flower randomly. I looked through every single plumeria there just to find the
            most perfect one, because that’s the one that matched how I saw you. The others were
            wilting, and I might’ve wilted too… but you were still there, blooming as ever.
