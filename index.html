          <p>hi rayaa, I don’t know why I’m writing this when I know it won’t reach you</p>
          <p>
            maybe it’s the sound of the waves? The view being nostalgic back when I used to wish that
            you were here with me to experience the view together, take morning strolls here together.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don’t know why you keep popping up in my mind in every place I used to go when we wrre
            still together, was it because I wished you were there with me everytime I visited new
            places? Everytime I thought a view was beautiful? I can’t help but imagine your smile
            seeing this view while I admire you

            I miss you so much, but I know everytime I returned it hurt you, everytime I returned it
            took pieces of you
          </p>
          <p>
            I don’t wanna hurt you, so I’ll take this love with me forever, I love you I’m sorry it
            may be one sided, but I wish I could find my way back to you without causing you pain.
            you’re still worth very much for me raya, you matter a lot if this message ever reaches
            u, I hope I could make up my mistakes with you someday.

          <p>
            you were never just another person in my life. you were my first love—the first person
            i ever saw a future with, the first and only one i truly thought i could marry. you
            still matter to me more than you realize, even now.
          </p>
          <p>
            and i really hope you find a place where you feel like you belong, even if it isn’t
            with me.

          <h2><span class="lead">still yours</span></h2>
          <p>
            I saw a TikTok asking “what song do you refuse to play because of the memories?” and I
            immediately thought of Bad by w2e. It's all you, I've never dedicated another song to
            anybody but you. I'm happy that I still have something that connects me to you, but it
            also hurts having a connection to you without having you. Life feels ephemeral without
            you.

          <h2><span class="lead">Unconditional</span></h2>
          <p>
            you were, and still are, my image of unconditional love. the seven months we had weren’t
            perfect, but you stayed—loving me even when it was hard for you, even when i didn’t
            treat you the way you deserved, even when i was immature.
          </p>
          <p>
            it wasn’t the best for me either, but deep down i knew you were the embodiment of
            unconditional love. i hate that it took me so long to realize that. i hate that i took
            you for granted while you were there, loving me in every way you could.
          </p>
          <p>
            and now i want to reciprocate what you gave me. i’d do anything just to give back even a
            portion of the love you once gave me. i know the love i gave you back then might not
            have been the kind of love you imagined or needed, and i know i’m too late. i ruined the
            one chance you gave me to make it right, and it kills me.

          <h2><span class="lead">The Plumeria</span></h2>
          <p>
            I’m not sure if you remember, but do you remember when I took a picture of a plumeria
            flower? And I told you, “while the other flowers were starting to rot, you were there
            perfect as everrr hihihi.” Mwuahahaha.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still see you the same way. Like that flower—still perfect in my eyes. Maybe you see
            me as one of the plumerias that wilted, and maybe I did. But I want you to know I didn’t
            pick that flower randomly. I looked through every single plumeria there just to find the
            most perfect one, because that’s the one that matched how I saw you. The others were
            wilting, and I might’ve wilted too… but you were still there, blooming as ever.
